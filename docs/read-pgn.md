# Read PGN

âœ¨ Portable Game Notation is a human-readable text format that allows chess players to read and write chess games.

There are three different variants supported with the default one being classical chess.

| Variant | Chessboard |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Capablanca | [Chess\Variant\Capablanca\Board](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/Variant/Capablanca/BoardTest.php) |
| Chess960 | [Chess\Variant\Chess960\Board](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/Variant/Chess960/BoardTest.php) |
| Classical | [Chess\Variant\Classical\Board](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/Variant/Classical/BoardTest.php) |

Both Capablanca and Chess960 were originally conceived to minimize memorization. So when it comes to chess openings, it is assumed that we're in the realms of classical chess as well. Let's now have a look at B54 which is the ECO code for "Sicilian Defense: Modern Variations, Main Line".

```php
use Chess\Variant\Classical\Board;

$board = new Board();
$board->play('w', 'e4');
$board->play('b', 'c5');
$board->play('w', 'Nf3');
$board->play('b', 'd6');
$board->play('w', 'd4');
$board->play('b', 'cxd4');
$board->play('w', 'Nxd4');

echo $board->toAsciiString();
```

```text
r  n  b  q  k  b  n  r
p  p  .  .  p  p  p  p
.  .  .  p  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  N  P  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
P  P  P  .  .  P  P  P
R  N  B  Q  K  B  .  R
```

As discussed in [Getting Started](https://php-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/), the PGN format is convenient for when reading chess games annotated by humans, for example, those ones available in online databases or published in chess websites.

So far so good, but if you're new to chess you may well play a wrong move in the Sicilian Defense: 4...Na6.

```php
$board->play('b', 'Na6');

echo $board->toAsciiString();
```

```text
r  .  b  q  k  b  n  r
p  p  .  .  p  p  p  p
n  .  .  p  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  N  P  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
P  P  P  .  .  P  P  P
R  N  B  Q  K  B  .  R
```

No worries! We've all been there. The `undo()` method comes to the rescue to fix mistakes like this one.

```php
$board = $board->undo();
$board->play('b', 'Nf6');

echo $board->getMovetext();
```

```text
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6
```

Now, what if you want to play a bunch of PGN moves at once instead of one by one as in the previous example? This is a common use case, and [Chess\Play\SanPlay](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/blob/master/tests/unit/Play/SanPlayTest.php) allows to easily do so. As it name implies, this class is intended to play a Standard Algebaric Notation (SAN) movetext. The validate() method will throw a Chess\Exception\PlayException if the movetext is not valid.

```php
use Chess\Play\SanPlay;

$movetext = '1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6';

$board = (new SanPlay($movetext))
    ->validate()
    ->getBoard();

echo $board->toAsciiString();
```

```text
r  n  b  q  k  b  .  r
p  p  .  .  p  p  p  p
.  .  .  p  .  n  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  N  P  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
P  P  P  .  .  P  P  P
R  N  B  Q  K  B  .  R
```

The game can be continued from this position â€” remember, almost everything in PHP Chess is done using a chessboard object.

```php
$board->play('w', 'Bb5+');

echo $board->toAsciiString();
```

```text
r  n  b  q  k  b  .  r
 p  p  .  .  p  p  p  p
 .  .  .  p  .  n  .  .
 .  B  .  .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  N  P  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 P  P  P  .  .  P  P  P
 R  N  B  Q  K  .  .  R
```

Every time a move is made, the state of the board changes and now the white king is in check.

```php
var_dump($board->isCheck());
```

```text
bool(true)
```

Of course the king is not mated in this position.

```php
var_dump($board->isMate());
```

```text
bool(false)
```

Also it is not stalemated.

```php
var_dump($board->isStalemate());
```

```text
bool(false)
```

And it is not a fivefold repetition yet.

```php
var_dump($board->isFivefoldRepetition());
```

```text
bool(false)
```

Otherwise the game would end.

[Numeric Annotation Glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_Annotation_Glyphs) (NAGs) can optionally be used in SAN movetexts, so this is how you'd typically validate a SAN movetext using NAGs for further processing. Remember, the validate() method will throw a Chess\Exception\PlayException if the movetext is not valid.

```php
use Chess\Play\SanPlay;

$movetext = '1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 $1 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 $48 Nf6 $113';

$sanPlay = (new SanPlay($movetext))->validate();

echo $sanPlay->getSanMovetext()->filtered();
```

```text
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 $1 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 $48 Nf6 $113
```

NAGs can be removed by passing the false value to the filtered() method.

```php
echo $sanPlay->getSanMovetext()->filtered($nags = false);
```

```text
1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6
```
