# Convert FEN

ðŸ“Œ Almost everything in PHP Chess can be done with a chessboard object.

FEN stands for Forsyth-Edwards Notation and is the standard way for describing chess positions using text strings. At some point you'll definitely want to convert a FEN string into a chessboard object, and this can be done according to the variants supported.
