PHP Chess is a library implemented in PHP that opens up a whole new range of possibilities to create chess apps.

One key feature is that it has been designed with OOP principles in mind and is thoroughly tested with plenty of unit tests. The unit tests are the best documentation because they contain hundreds of real examples on how to use the PHP Chess API.

The PHP Chess docs are more of a tutorial rather than an API description. Almost every class in the `src` folder represents a concept that is tested accordingly in the `tests/unit` folder, in other words, the `tests/unit` folder is mirroring the `src` folder. For further details on how to use a particular class, please feel free to browse the codebase and check out the corresponding tests.
