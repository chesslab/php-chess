PHP Chess is a library implemented in PHP that opens up a whole new range of possibilities to create chess web apps.

The present documentation is more of a tutorial rather than an API description. One key feature of PHP Chess is it has been designed with OOP principles in mind, and is thoroughly tested with a plethora of unit tests. The unit tests are the best documentation! They contain hundreds of real examples on how to use the PHP Chess API.

Almost every class in the `src` folder represents a concept that is tested accordingly in the `tests/unit` folder, in other words, the `tests/unit` folder is mirroring the `src` folder. For further details on how to use a particular class please check out the corresponding tests.
