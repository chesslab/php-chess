/**
 * HeuristicsTrait
 *
 * A chess game can be thought of in terms of snapshots describing what's going on
 * the board as reported by a number of evaluation features. Thus, it can be plotted
 * in terms of balance. +1 is the best possible evaluation for White and -1 the
 * best possible evaluation for Black. Both forces being set to 0 means they're
 * actually offset and, therefore, balanced.

     * The evaluation features that make up a heuristic picture.
     *
     * The sum of the weights equals to 100 as per a multiple-criteria decision analysis
     * (MCDA) based on the point allocation method. This allows to label input vectors
     * for further machine learning purposes.
     *
     * The order in which the different chess evaluation features are arranged as
     * a dimension doesn't really matter. The first permutation is used to somehow
     * highlight that a particular dimension is a restricted permutation actually.
     *
     * Let the grandmasters label chess positions. Once a particular position is
     * successfully transformed into an input vector of numbers, then it can be
     * labeled on the assumption that the best possible move that could be made
     * was made â€” by a chess grandmaster.
