 * HeuristicsTrait

 * A chess game can be thought of in terms of snapshots describing what's going on
 * the board as reported by a number of evaluation features. Thus, it can be plotted
 * in terms of balance. +1 is the best possible evaluation for White and -1 the
 * best possible evaluation for Black. Both forces being set to 0 means they're
 * actually offset and, therefore, balanced.

     * was made â€” by a chess grandmaster.
